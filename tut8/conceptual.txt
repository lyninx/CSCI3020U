1. What is an Abstract Data Type (ADT)?



2. Explain the difference between a queue (FIFO) and a stack (LIFO)
	FIFO = First In, First Out. 
	As you add values to the queue, the new values are put at the end of the queue. And when you remove values from the queue, the values are taken from the front.

	Index: [0, 1, 2]
	Values: [oldVal, oldVal, oldVal]

	enqueue()
	Index: [0, 1, 2, 3]
	Values: [oldVal, oldVal, oldVal, newVal]
	
	dequeue()
	Index: [0, 1, 2]
	Values: [oldVal, oldVal, newVal]

	LIFO = Last In, First Out
	As you add values to the stack, the new values are put on the top of the stack. As you remove them from the stack, they are taken off the top.

	Index: [0, 1, 2]
	Values: [oldVal, oldVal, oldVal]

	push()
	Index: [0, 1, 2, 3]
	Values: [newVal, oldVal, oldVal, oldVal]
	
	pop()
	Index: [0, 1, 2]
	Values: [oldVal, oldVal, oldVal]

3. Name and briefly explain three types of data structures.



4. Explain what a binary tree is, what are some common operations of a binary
tree?



5. Explain what a hash table (dictionary) is, what are common operations of a hash
table?
